### About Me

As a child, I would bring insects to my wary mother and she would always say, “Caroline you are either going to be an entomologist or a botanist.” I was given an echeveria amoena succulent when I was seven and knew at that moment what I wanted to do with my future.

I am an experienced plant retail merchandiser known for communication, problem solving, and detail driven analysis. I have developed a deep interest in plant-insect interactions as well as helping customers design native plant landscapes. A highlight of my day is seeing the hummingbird clearwing hawkmoths as well as other Lepidoptera species. 

I am an aspiring environmental science student at Southern New Hampshire University with a focus on combining environmental science and horticulture in my personal and professional life.
